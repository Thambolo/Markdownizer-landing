# Quick Start Guide

## Your Website is Ready! 🎉

### The Correct URL
Your website will be available at:
```
https://thambolo.github.io/Markdownizer-landing/
```

**Important:** Note the `/Markdownizer-landing/` at the end - this is required because your repository is a project site.

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Merge This PR
Merge this pull request to the `main` branch.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Scroll down and click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You'll see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Visit your site: `https://thambolo.github.io/Markdownizer-landing/`

## Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing security warning"
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try incognito/private mode
- Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
- See `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for details

### "404 Not Found"
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
- Check that the workflow completed successfully in Actions tab
- Wait a few minutes - it can take time to propagate

### "Workflow not running"
- Make sure you merged to the `main` branch
- Go to Actions tab and manually trigger "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
